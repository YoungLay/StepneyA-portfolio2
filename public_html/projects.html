            <p>Portfolio 1 was the first web site that we created. It is a less<br />
                advanced version of Portfolio 2. This web site contains<br />
                information about CSS and HTML but lacks information about<br />
                Bootstrap. </p>
            <h2>Portfolio 2</h2>
            <p>Portfolio 2 is our second web site. It is a more advanced version<br />
            of Portfolio 1. This web site also contains information about CSS<br />
            and HTML plus Bootstrap. </p>
